# Price Notifier for Dalamud

Price Notifier is a plugin meant to help you on your marketboard journey. The plugin will notify you when the price of an item drops below a configurable threshold, thus saving you the time needed to check said item on a regular basis. Useful when selling many items[^1], or when looking to buy items for low prices.

Add/Remove items and set their threshold. Automatically inserts items sold by retainers when their "Items for sale" list is open.

**_NOTE: Marketboard information is pulled from [Universalis](https://github.com/Universalis-FFXIV/Universalis), and may not always be accurate._**

[^1]: The plugin's aim is _not_ to encourage undercutting. Don't be "That Guy", if possible. Please.
